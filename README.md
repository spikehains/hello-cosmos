# hello-cosmos
This project was created as a way of learning to use git. When I started programming early in my career, we used Visual SourceSafe. Later we switched to Subversion because we could use Trac for ticketing in a connected way to source code changes. As my career focused more and strategy and planning, I wasn't in the code anymore.

This hello-cosmos is here for me to learn and review GitHub, branching, and using Git.
