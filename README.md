# hello-cosmos
Created as part of learning to use git.

Started with Visual SourceSafe, moved to Subversion, then became an architect and wasn't in the code anymore. It was then that the world switched to Git. I didn't switch with it so now I'm playing catch-up.

This hello-world is here for me to learn.

Sometime later, I update this to offer a broader greeting.

Still learning all the things.

This note was committed directly to the the branch called spikehains-patch-1.
